Introduction
------------

Welcome to the `Pine Script User Manual <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/index.html>`__. 
In this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually become more familiar with indicators and strategies (also called *scripts*) 
written in the Pine Script programming language on `TradingView <https://www.tradingview.com/>`__:

1. How to use the tens of thousands of existing scripts.
2. How to read the Pine code of existing scripts.
3. How to learn to write Pine scripts.

If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready to learn how to write your own,
then jump to the :ref:`<PageFirstIndicator_WritingScripts>` section of this page.


Using scripts
-------------

If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on TradingView, 
you can first start exploring the thousands of indicators already available on our platform. 
You can access existing indicators on the platform in two different ways:

- By using the chart's "Indicators & Strategies" button, or
- By browsing TradingView's `Puclic Library <https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/>`__, 
  the largest repository of scripts in the world, with more than 100,000 scripts, most of which are free and open-source, which means you can see their Pine code.

If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a good way to get started and gradually become proficient as a script user, 
until you are ready to start your programming journey in Pine.




From the chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To explore and load scripts from you chart, use the "Indicators & Strategies" button:

The dialog box presents different categories of scripts in its left pane:

- **My scripts** displays the scipts you have written and saved in the Pine Editor. They are saved in TradingView's cloud.
- **Built-ins** groups the classic trading indicators that TradingView has written (mostly in Pine) and which are available for free.
- **Candlestick Patterns** are also built-ins supplied by TradingView. They have their distinct category because there are many.
- **Public Library** is where you can search from the 100,000 published scripts written by TradingView users.
- **Volume Profile** includes volume profile indicators supplied by TradingView, but only available to Pro and Premium accounts.

Here, the section containing the TradingView built-ins is selected:

When you click on one of the indicators or strategies (the ones with the green and red arrows following their name), it loads on your chart.


From the Public Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From `TradingView's homepage <https://www.tradingview.com/>`__, you can bring up the Public Library's script stream from the "Community" menu. 
Here, we are pointing to the "Editors' Picks" section, but there are many other categories you can choose from:

You can also search for scripts using the homepage's "Search" field, and filter scripts using different criteria. 
The Help Center has a page explaining more about `loading scripts <https://www.tradingview.com/script/?solution=43000555216>`__.
